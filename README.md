# Newark Central
## About
During the Preduential hackathon we were tasked with creating a new way to unify the community of Newark. My team and I decided to cocme with a universal and quick chat client that allowed people to jump into chat rooms anonymously so that they could speak their mind freely.

This application would later recieve an honerable mention.

## Technical
This application is a major fork of my previous work NewChat with some heavy modifications. Still running NodeJS and Socket.io, however the frontend also uses Bootstrap as well as jQuery.
